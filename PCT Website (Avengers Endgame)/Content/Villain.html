                    <li class="bullet2">While other villains have presented threats to the Avengers, none of them have been able to compare to the Mad Titan Thanos. Serving as the looming threat throughout the entire Infinity Saga, Thanos was on a mission to unite the six Infinity Stones so he could wipe out half the universe, a feat he accomplished in Infinity War. His victory was undone in Endgame, and he was ultimately defeated by Iron Man, but it took essentially every single hero in the MCU coming together to stop him
                    </li>
                    <li class="bullet2">Thanos was originally played by actor and stuntman Damion Poitier in the post-credits scene for The Avengers before being played by Josh Brolin for the rest of his MCU appearances. Josh Brolin is a talented actor with a diverse filmography including The Goonies, No Country for Old Men, and Deadpool 2

His massive size and strength made him a dangerous opponent for the Avengers as he fought against them multiple times in Infinity War and Endgame. He was eventually killed by Bruce Banner in the Battle of Wakanda in Infinity War and the alternate timeline version of Cull Obsidian died in Endgame when he was stepped on by the giant version of Ant-Man during the final battle.

It was the alternate timeline version of Ebony Maw that realized Nebula was from another timeline, putting the Avengers' plan in jeopardy in Endgame.

                    <li class="bullet2">When Ultron wanted to upgrade his physical form in Avengers: Age of Ultron, he turned to black-market trader Ulysses Klaue. Ulysses Klaue stole billions of dollars worth of vibranium from Wakanda, allowing Ultron to create a stronger body for himself. In a fit of rage, Ultron ended up cutting off one of Klaue's arms during their deal. Ulysses Klaue was eventually killed by Killmonger in Black Panther.
                    </li>
                    <li class="bullet2">The role of Ulysses Klaue provided Andy Serkis with an opportunity to show his actual face on the screen. Andy Serkis is best known for his groundbreaking motion-capture work as Gollum in the Lord of the Rings franchise, Caesar in the Planet of the Apes movies, and King Kong in Peter Jackson's King Kong. He is also the director of the upcoming movie Venom: Let There Be Carnage and will play Alfred Pennyworth in The Batman.

They captured the base's commanding officer, Baron Wolfgang von Strucker, who had been experimenting on the tragic Maximoff twins, using Loki's scepter to give the two superhuman abilities. He was later killed by Ultron as a statement to the Avengers.

In the post-credits scene, it is revealed that the Other was working for Thanos all along. The Other was later killed by Ronan the Accuser in Guardians of the Galaxy.

Armed with the Tesseract, his scepter, and a Chitauri army, Loki was a worthy first test for the Avengers but ultimately proved to be no match for their combined strength.
                    </li>
                    <li class="bullet2">The role of Loki in the MCU has made actor Tom Hiddleston into a household name. The actor has appeared in movies such as Kong: Skull Island and Crimson Peak and will return to the role that made him famous in the upcoming Disney+ show Loki.
